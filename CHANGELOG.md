# Changelog

## v3.0

v3.0 uses a component + helper architecture that removes several hacks in previous versions, and 
integrates with ember-cli as an addon.

- Projects that don't use ember-cli will need to stay on the v2.0 branch
- You now need to add `{{ember-notify}}` to one of your templates, usually in `application.hbs`.
